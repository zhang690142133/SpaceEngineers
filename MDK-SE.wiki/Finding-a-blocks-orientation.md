If you need a block's orientation for whatever reason, an easy way to tell is by looking at its rotation hints cube while holding the block, see it top-right in this screenshot:

If you don't see it: cycle HUD until block descriptions show up, and if still not there then re-enable it from Options -> Game -> Show Rotation Hints.

The cube has **Red/Green/Blue** sides, those point towards **Right/Up/Back** (the +X/Y/Z directions), and that's pretty much it!

In the case of the piston above, it extends towards Up/Y.

Keep in mind that a lot of blocks do not need to have a certain orientation to function.

For example the original 2 merge blocks merge towards their Right and the newer 1x1x1 merge block merges towards Up.

Some blocks do have reliable orientations, for example:
- Cockpits and RCs because flight inputs rely on block orientation;
- Camera because view is determined by block orientation;
- Thrusters only have one reliable direction, that being Forward where the flame comes out (therefore it pushes the ship towards its Back direction, the blue face on the rotation hints cube).
